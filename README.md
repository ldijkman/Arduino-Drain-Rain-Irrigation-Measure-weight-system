Arduino Drain Rain Irrigation Measure weight system

top funnel with NO solenoid valve (wich closes if bottom funnel valve is open)

bottom funnel with NC solenoid valve wich hangs in load cell HX711 for weight measuring

fluss bottom funnel at end of day or when full, all weighing data saved to comma seperated CSV file on SDcard for graphics daily view

Arduino with 4x20 i2c LCD and rotary encoder, load cell HX711.

low cost, low power usage standalone system (possible battery powered for in field testing dripplers)

easy to calibrate loadcell weight settings by rotary encoder menu

everything logged to sd card
