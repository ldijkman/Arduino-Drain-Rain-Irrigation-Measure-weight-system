Arduino Drain Rain Irrigation Measure weight system

top funnel with NO solenoid valve (wich closes if bottom funnel valve is open)

bottom funnel with NC solenoid valve wich hangs in load cell HX711 for water weight measuring

fluss bottom funnel at end of day or when full, all weighing data saved to comma seperated CSV file on SD-Card for graphics daily view

Arduino with 4x20 i2c LCD and rotary encoder, load cell HX711.

low cost, low power usage, standalone system (possible battery powered for in field testing dripplers)

easy to calibrate loadcell weight settings by rotary encoder menu and 4x20 LCD

weigth setting when to flush (open bottom valve and close top valve)

time how long to flush (time open bottom valve and close top valve) 

settings saved to eeprom

manual valve test from rotary encoder menu

all data logged each second to sd card daily CSV file

possible to monitor data via ethernet or webserver

keep track of drain, rain or dripler irrigation

monitor or check your drain, rain, irrigation system, irrigation drippers


---------------

Easy to use and maintain

Daily total water measured direct vissible on LCD display

-------------

Well, you could use a measure can to check drain or water given via drippers

but a measure can does not flush automaticly

and a measure can does not save any data to make graphics

charts can be viewed to see when, how much water is really given at the measuring location in the greenhouse

widely used as a measuring unit for drain measurement. 

Drain water is collected in the funnel  

Water Measurement for Agricultural Irrigation and Drainage Systems 

Effective irrigation water management begins with accurate water measurement. 

Water measurement is required to determine both total volumes of water and flow rates pumped. 

Measurement of volumes will verify that the proper amount of water is applied at each irrigation 

and that amounts permitted by water management districts are not exceeded. 

Flow rate measurements help to ensure that the irrigation system is operating properly. For example, lower than normal flow rates may indicate the need for pump repair or adjustment, partially closed or obstructed valves or pipelines, or clogged drip emitters. Higher than normal flow rates may indicate broken pipelines, defective flush valves, too many zones operating simultaneously, or eroded sprinkler nozzles.
